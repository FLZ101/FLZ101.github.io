These are called <strong>collocations </strong>and include:<br />adjectives + nouns, e.g. <em>rich vocabulary, classical music, commonsense;</em><br />verbs + nouns, e.g. <em>to express an opinion, to take sides;</em><br />nouns in phrases, e.g. <em>in touch with, a train set, a sense of humour;</em><br />words + prepositions, e.g. <em>at a loss for words, in particular.</em></li><li>Notice special grammatical characteristics of new words. For example, note irregular verbs,<br />e.g. <em>undertake, undertook, undertaken; uncountable nouns,</em><br />e.g. <em>luggage; or nouns that are only used in the plural</em>,<br />e.g. <em>scissors</em>.</li><li>Notice any special pronunciation problems with new words.</li><li>Check if the word is particularly formal or informal in character, in other words if it has a particular register.</li></ol><div class=\"section-rotate\"><span>C ‣ How can you help yourself to memorise words?</span><img class=\"speaker-louder\" source=\"data/U_001.C.mp3\" src=\"icons/speaker_louder.png\" title=\"C ‣ How can you help yourself to memorise words?\" /></div><p><img src=\"data/Unit1-1.jpg\" style=\"width:100%; max-width:500px; border-radius:10px;\" /></p><p>Research suggests that some students find it easier to learn words if they<br />(a) learn them in groups and<br />(b) make use of pictures, as shown here.</p><p>You can group words in any way you like &ndash; topic, grammatical feature, word root, and soon.

After that, they may go to a <strong>nursery school</strong>. Between the ages of five and 11, children attend <strong>primary school</strong>, where they learn the basics of reading, writing, arithmetic, etc. For most children, secondary education begins when they enter a <strong>comprehensive school</strong> or a more traditional <strong>grammar school</strong> (to which they <strong>gain admission</strong> by sitting an exam). The famous UK <strong>public schools</strong> are in fact private, fee-paying schools. Between the ages of 11 and 18, young people take a wide range of subjects in arts, sciences and technical areas. In the UK, pupils can leaves school at the age of 16, although many young people choose to remain in full-time education until the age of 18. (In England it is <strong>compulsory </strong>for young people to continue with some form of education or training until they are 18 [they must do it], even if they also have a job.)

People are also worried about the <strong>greenhouse effect</strong>, where an increase in the amount of carbon dioxide [CO2] and other <strong>gases</strong><sup>9</sup> in the Earth&rsquo;s <strong>atmosphere</strong><sup>10</sup> causes a gradual warming of the surface of the Earth. This global warming is leading to the thawing of the <strong>polar ice caps</strong><sup>11</sup> and all this is causing concern about <strong>climate change</strong>.

Some farmers produce <strong>organic </strong>food, which avoids the use of harmful chemicals. More companies try to behave in a way that is <strong>environmentally friendly</strong> or <strong>ecologically sound</strong>. Societies attempt to <strong>dispose of waste</strong> in a more responsible way, by, for example, <strong>recycling </strong>as much as possible.

This is a description of Cork, one of Ireland&rsquo;s main cities. Which words or phrases might be useful for describing your own or another town?</p><p class=\"box_shadow_para\"><img src=\"data/Unit25-1.jpg\" style=\"width:100%; max-width:200px; margin-right:20px; float:left\" /> Cork city is the major metropolis of the south; indeed, with a <strong>population </strong>of about 119,500, it is the second largest city in the Republic. The main business and shopping centre of the town lies on the island created by two channels of the River Lee, with many of the <strong>suburbs </strong>within walking distance of the centre. The buses tend to be overcrowded and the one-way <strong>traffic system</strong> is extremely complicated. In the hilly area of the city is the famous Shandon Steeple, the bell-tower of St Anne&rsquo;s Church, built on the site of a church destroyed when the city was besieged by the English in 1690. Back across the River Lee lies the city&rsquo;s cathedral, an imposing 19th-century building in the French Gothic style. Cork has two markets. Neither caters specifically for tourists but those who enjoy the <strong>lively </strong>atmosphere of a real working market will appreciate their charm. The town has good sports and arts facilities. The Crawford Art Gallery is well worth a visit. It regularly puts on <strong>adventurous </strong>exhibitions by <strong>contemporary </strong>artists. The fashionable residential districts of Cork city overlook the <strong>picturesque </strong>harbour. There are other residential areas on the <strong>outskirts</strong>.</p><div class=\"section-rotate\"><span>B ‣ Facilities</span><img class=\"speaker-louder\" source=\"data/U_025.B.mp3\" src=\"icons/speaker_louder.png\" title=\"B ‣ Facilities\" /></div><p>Sports: <strong>swimming pool&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; sports centre &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; golf course &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; tennis courts &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; football pitch &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; skating rink</strong></p><p>Culture: <strong>theatre &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; opera house&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; concert hall&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; radio station&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; art gallery</strong></p><p>Education: <strong>school&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; college&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; university&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; library&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; adult education centre &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; museum</strong></p><p>Catering, accommodation and night-life: <strong>restaurant&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; take-away&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; hotel &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; B&amp;B</strong> (bed and breakfast) &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>youth hostel &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; club</strong></p><p>Transport: <strong>bus service&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; taxi rank &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; car hire &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; car park &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; parking meters</strong></p><p>Other: <strong>health centre&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; law courts&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; registry office&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; citizens&rsquo; advice bureau&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; job centre&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; department store &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; chemist&rsquo;s &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; garden centre &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; police station&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Town/City Hall&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; estate agent &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; housing estate&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; industrial estate</strong></p><div class=\"section-rotate\"><span>C ‣ Problems in cities </span><img class=\"speaker-louder\" source=\"data/U_025.C.mp3\" src=\"icons/speaker_louder.png\" title=\"C ‣ Problems in cities\" /></div><p></p><table class=\"tbl-1-2\"><tbody><tr class=\"background-2\"><td>problem</td><td>effect</td><td>cause</td></tr><tr><td>traffic jams</td><td>traffic very slow; commuters get very stressed</td><td>too much traffic, especially in the rush hour</td></tr><tr><td>slums</td><td>housing in a bad condition</td><td>poverty - people don&rsquo;t have money to spend on housing</td></tr><tr><td>vandalism</td><td>pointless destruction of property</td><td>poverty; lack of hope</td></tr><tr><td>overcrowding</td><td>difficult living conditions</td><td>too many people living in one place</td></tr><tr><td>pollution</td><td>deterioration in health</td><td>traffic and industrial</td></tr></tbody></table><div class=\"section-rotate\"><span>D ‣ Adjectives to describe a city </span><img class=\"speaker-louder\" source=\"data/U_025.D.mp3\" src=\"icons/speaker_louder.png\" title=\"D ‣ Adjectives to describe a city\" /></div><p><strong>picturesque </strong>[very pretty and attractive], <strong>historic</strong>, <strong>spacious </strong>[with plenty of space], <strong>elegant</strong>, <strong>magnificent</strong>, <strong>lively</strong>, <strong>deserted </strong>[no one on the streets, e.g. at night], <strong>bustling </strong>[with lots of movement], <strong>packed </strong>[very crowded], <strong>filthy</strong> [very dirty], <strong>run-down</strong> [in a very bad condition]</p><div class=\"common-mistakes-cover\"><h3>Common <span>mistakes</span></h3><div><p><em>There are a lot of open </em><strong>spaces </strong><em>in the centre of London.</em> (NOT There are a lot of open <s>places</s> in &hellip;)</p></div></div>",

The introductory page is called the <strong>home page</strong>. From this there are <strong>links </strong>to other pages. Good websites are easy to <strong>navigate </strong>or find your way around. One option on many websites is an <strong>FAQ </strong>page. This stands for &#39;frequently asked questions&#39;, a list of common questions and helpful answers.<br />You can <strong>bookmark </strong>websites that you <strong>log on</strong><sup>1</sup> to frequently.<br />If a website gets a lot of <strong>hits</strong>, that means that it has been visited by a lot of people.</p><p>Sometimes you need to <strong>subscribe to</strong> a site, which means you become a member of it. This may involve having a special <strong>username </strong>and choosing a <strong>password</strong>. You will only be able to <strong>log in</strong><sup>2</sup> to the site if you <strong>enter </strong>this information correctly.</p>You can store your data on your computer or phone, or you can store it in the <strong>cloud</strong><sup>3</sup>.</div><p><sup>1</sup> <em>opp </em>= <strong>log off</strong><br /><sup>2</sup> <em>opp </em>= <strong>log out</strong><br /><sup>3</sup> a network of servers on the Internet where data can be stored and viewed from any device</p><div class=\"section-rotate\"><span>B ‣ Online communication </span><img class=\"speaker-louder\" source=\"data/U_035.B.mp3\" src=\"icons/speaker_louder.png\" title=\"B ‣ Online communication\" /></div><p></p><div class=\"box_shadow_para\"><img src=\"data/Unit35-2.jpg\" style=\"width:100%; max-width:200px; margin-right:20px; float:left; border-radius:10px\" /> You can communicate with others by email. With an email you can include an <strong>attachment</strong>. You can <strong>attach </strong>a photo, for example. You can also send someone an <strong>e-card</strong>. A <strong>server </strong>is a powerful central computer from which other computers get information. If your (<strong>ISP</strong>) <strong>internet service provider</strong>&#39;s server is <strong>down </strong>[not functioning], you may not be able to send emails.<p>You can use your computer to <strong>Skype </strong>friends and family - the software allows you to make phone calls using your computer and the Internet, and you can see which people on your <strong>contact list</strong> are online at the same time. If you each have a <strong>webcam</strong>, you can see each other as you talk.</p><p>Many modern online programs can be called <strong>interactive</strong>, i.e. they allow users to become involved in the exchange of information. For example, <strong>social networking</strong> sites like Facebook are a popular way for people to keep in touch with their friends.</p>A <strong>wiki </strong>is a website which allows users to add, delete and edit its contents. Wikipedia is perhaps the world&#39;s largest wiki. <strong>Blogs </strong>are also interactive as they are a kind of online diary that readers can add comments to. Many people are involved in <strong>online gaming</strong>, playing with people who they have never met. Often these games make use of <strong>virtual reality</strong>. [a set of images and sounds produced by a computer, which represent a place or a situation that the gamer can take part in]</div>",

This month we loved CatNapp, a new social media app that allows users to share information about their favourite pets.</strong></span><p>We found it very easy to use. You create a <strong>profile </strong>of your cat, <strong>upload </strong>a favourite <strong>photo </strong>and include some basic information about it (age, colour, favourite food). You can then <strong>post updates</strong> about what your cat has been doing, <strong>share links</strong><sup>1</sup> to things you find interesting or <strong>comment </strong>on other cats&rsquo; profiles. You can <strong>rate </strong>videos of other cats&rsquo; adventures (from one to five stars) or see how many <strong>views</strong><sup>2</sup> or <strong>likes</strong><sup>3</sup> your post got. The most popular post each month wins a prize!</p>We found it a little annoying that you can&rsquo;t turn off <strong>notifications</strong><sup>4</sup> when a friend writes something new, but overall cat lovers will adore it. <span style=\"color:#800080;\">Highly recommended.</span></div><p><sup>1</sup> connections to other websites<br /><sup>2</sup> times people have watched it<br /><sup>3</sup> times people have clicked &lsquo;like&rsquo;<br /><sup>4</sup> messages to tell you when something has happened</p><div class=\"common-mistakes-cover language-help-cover\"><h3>Language <span>help</span></h3><div><p>Many of the words in this unit are used as both nouns and verbs.

For example, often your <strong>profile picture</strong> is <strong>public</strong>, but you can usually make posts on your <strong>timeline </strong>[collection of photos and other posts on your profile] private.</li><li>Remember that if you are <strong>tagged </strong>[your name and a link to your profile is added] in someone else&rsquo;s post, it might be seen by a lot of people you don&rsquo;t know. You can ask people to remove the tag if necessary.</li><li>Use <strong>direct messages</strong> [messages that only the people in the conversation can see] for private conversations, especially if you discuss where you live, paying for things, etc.</li><li>Delete old <strong>accounts </strong>on sites that you are not using anymore. You might forget what information they contain, or the <strong>default </strong>[what happens automatically if you don&rsquo;t change it] privacy settings might change.</li></ol></div>",

Fancy you being married! I&rsquo;m not married but I&rsquo;ve got a boyfriend called Tom.</p>I must tell you about him. We&rsquo;ve known each other for three years. I <strong>quite liked</strong> him when we first met, but I didn&rsquo;t really <strong>fancy </strong>him in any big way. I did like being with him - he <strong>fascinated </strong>me with his stories of his travels around the world and something mysterious about his past <strong>attracted </strong>me. What&rsquo;s more, we were both keen on sailing. Little by little I <strong>fell in love</strong> with him. His sense of humour <strong>appealed to</strong> me and I was <strong>captivated by</strong> his smiling eyes. Now, three years later, I can&rsquo;t see why I didn&rsquo;t <strong>fall for</strong> him the moment we met. He&rsquo;s a very caring person, fond of animals and small children. He&rsquo;s always <strong>affectionate </strong>and <strong>loving towards</strong> me and <strong>passionate </strong>both <strong>about </strong>me and about the things he believes in and the people he <strong>cares for</strong>. I hope we&rsquo;ll always be as <strong>devoted to</strong> each other as we are now.<p>Do write again soon and tell me all about your life!</p>Love,<br />Amy</div><div class=\"section-rotate\"><span>B ‣ Words and expressions relating to disliking </span><img class=\"speaker-louder\" source=\"data/U_044.B.mp3\" src=\"icons/speaker_louder.png\" title=\"B ‣ Words and expressions relating to disliking\" /></div><p><strong>Loathe, detest, despise, cannot stand</strong> and <strong>cannot bear</strong> are all stronger ways of saying &#39;dislike&#39; and they are all followed by a noun or an -<em>ing </em>form.</p><p>I <strong>loathe / detest / despise / can&#39;t stand / can&#39;t bear</strong> bad-mannered people.

What is sometimes referred to as a &#39;sixth sense&#39; (or extrasensory perception) is a power to be aware of things independently of the five physical senses - a kind of supernatural sense.

[topic causing great argument and controversy]</p><p><u>Whether the war could have been avoided</u> is a <strong>question </strong>that interests historians.</p><p>Let&#39;s discuss <u>crime</u>.

In the following example, the words in bold concern a problem or a solution. Try to learn these words as a family.</p><p class=\"box_shadow_para\">The <strong>situation </strong>in our cities with regard to traffic is going from bad to worse. Congestion is a daily feature of urban life. The <strong>problem </strong>is now beginning to <strong>affect </strong>our national economies. Unless a new <strong>approach </strong>is found to control traffic, we will never find a <strong>solution </strong>to the <strong>dilemma</strong>.</p><p>In the dialogue below, two politicians are arguing. Note how the words in bold refer to parts of the argument.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"box_shadow_para\"><strong>A:</strong> <strong>Your claim</strong> that we&#39;re doing nothing to invest in industry is false. We invested &pound;10 billion last year. You&#39;ve ignored <strong>this fact</strong>.</p><p class=\"box_shadow_para\"><strong>B:</strong> But the investment has all gone to service industries. <strong>The real point</strong> is that we need to invest in our manufacturing industries.</p><p class=\"box_shadow_para\"><strong>A:</strong> <strong>That argument</strong> is out-of-date in a modern technological society. <strong>Our position</strong> has always been that we should encourage technology.</p><p class=\"box_shadow_para\"><strong>B:</strong> But <strong>that view</strong> won&#39;t help to reduce unemployment.</p><p>The following problem-solution words are grouped in families associated with the underlined key words. The prepositions normally used with them are given in brackets.</p><p><strong><u>situation</u>:</strong> <strong>state of affairs, position</strong> (<em>with regard to</em>)<br /><strong><u>problem</u>:</strong> <strong>difficulty </strong>(more formal), <strong>crisis, matter</strong><br /><u><strong>response</strong></u> (<em>to</em>)<strong>:</strong> <strong>reaction </strong>(<em>to</em>), <strong>attitude </strong>(<em>to</em>), <strong>approach </strong>(<em>to</em>)<br /><strong><u>solution</u>:</strong> <strong>answer </strong>(<em>to</em>), <strong>resolution </strong>(<em>to</em>), <strong>key </strong>(<em>to</em>), <strong>way out</strong> (<em>of</em>)<br /><u><strong>evaluation</strong></u> (of the solution)<strong>:</strong> <strong>assessment, judgment</strong></p><p class=\"box_shadow_para\">Economically, the government is in a critical <strong>position</strong>. This <strong>state of affairs</strong> is partly a result of the financial <strong>difficulties </strong>currently being experienced globally. Our government&#39;s initial <strong>response </strong>to the <strong>situation </strong>was to impose higher taxes. This <strong>approach </strong>has not proved to be the <strong>solution </strong>to the problem. Economists&#39; current <strong>assessment </strong>is that this may in fact be making <strong>matters </strong>worse.</p>",

Such expressions are frequently combinations of two nouns, e.g. <strong>car park, human being</strong> [person], <strong>science fiction</strong> [fiction based on some kind of scientific fantasy]. A number of compound nouns are related to phrasal verbs and these are dealt with in <u>Unit 76</u>.</p><div class=\"section-rotate\"><span>B ‣ How are compound nouns written? </span><img class=\"speaker-louder\" source=\"data/U_075.B.mp3\" src=\"icons/speaker_louder.png\" title=\"B ‣ How are compound nouns written?\" /></div><p>If you understand both parts of the compound noun, the meaning will usually be clear. Compound nouns are usually written as two words, e.g. <strong>tin opener</strong> [an opener for tins], <strong>bank account</strong> [an account in a bank], <strong>pedestrian crossing</strong> [a place for people to cross a road], but sometimes they are written with a hyphen instead of a space between the words, e.g. <strong>self-control </strong>[control over your own emotions and reactions].

For example, the expression <strong>to feel under the weather</strong>, which means &#39;to feel unwell&#39;, is typical. The words do not tell us what it means, but the context usually helps.</p><p>Think of multi-word expressions as units, just like single words; always record the whole expression in your notebook, along with information on grammar and collocation, e.g. This tin opener <strong>has seen better days</strong>. [it is rather old and broken down; usually of things, always perfect tense form]</p><p>Multi-word expressions of this type are often rather informal and include a personal comment on the situation. They are sometimes humorous or ironic. As with any informal words, be careful how you use them. Never use them just to sound &#39;fluent&#39; or &#39;good at English&#39;.

Robert didn&#39;t altogether like the sound of Carl but he was doing his best to <strong>set aside</strong><sup>6</sup> his negative feelings.</p><p><sup>1</sup> reserving<br /><sup>2</sup> beginning a journey<br /><sup>3</sup> begun something with a particular aim in mind<br /><sup>4</sup> caused<br /><sup>5</sup> establish<br /><sup>6</sup> ignore (not think about)</p><div class=\"section-rotate\"><span>B ‣ Phrasal verbs with put </span><img class=\"speaker-louder\" source=\"data/U_092.B.mp3\" src=\"icons/speaker_louder.png\" title=\"B ‣ Phrasal verbs with put\" /></div><p><em>Note:</em> It would not normally be natural to use all of these expressions together.</p><p class=\"box_shadow_para\">Emma <strong>put </strong>her own name <strong>forward</strong><sup>1</sup> for election to the staff committee. Ten other people had also <strong>put in</strong><sup>2</sup> proposal forms but Emma was elected because she is very good at <strong>putting </strong>her ideas <strong>across</strong><sup>3</sup>. She also has a talent for <strong>putting </strong>her opponents <strong>down</strong><sup>4</sup>. At the first meeting she was largely silent though occasionally she would <strong>put in</strong><sup>5</sup> a remark.<br /><br />At the next meeting she was more involved. She supported the proposal that central heating should be <strong>put in</strong><sup>6</sup> in the staff canteen and agreed to help <strong>put together</strong><sup>7</sup> some new flat-pack furniture for the canteen. She also voted for the local school being allowed to use the staff club to <strong>put on</strong><sup>8</sup> a play. She insisted that the play would not <strong>put</strong> staff <strong>out</strong><sup>9</sup> at all provided that the school <strong>put </strong>all their props <strong>away</strong><sup>10</sup> after each performance. She said that she would <strong>put up</strong><sup>11</sup> relatives coming from other towns to watch the play. She argued that the committee should <strong>put off</strong><sup>12</sup> making their decision about <strong>putting up</strong><sup>13</sup> staff club membership subscriptions until they had found out how staff felt about this. She agreed to <strong>put up</strong><sup>14</sup> posters encouraging all staff to come to the next committee meeting.<br /><br />Later that evening Emma made her mother laugh as she imitated other committee members - she&#39;s good at <strong>putting on</strong><sup>15</sup> all sorts of accents. &#39;The chairperson really <strong>put </strong>me <strong>off</strong><sup>16</sup> with his constant sniffing,&#39; she said, &#39;and I don&#39;t know how they <strong>put up with</strong><sup>17</sup> the secretary&#39;s rudeness.&#39;</p><p><sup>1</sup> proposed<br /><sup>2</sup> submitted<br /><sup>3</sup> communicating<br /><sup>4</sup> making someone look small<br /><sup>5</sup> say something<br /><sup>6</sup> installed<br /><sup>7</sup> assemble<br /><sup>8</sup> present<br /><sup>9</sup> inconvenience<br /><sup>10</sup> tidied<br /><sup>11</sup> give accommodation to<br /><sup>12</sup> postpone<br /><sup>13</sup> raising<br /><sup>14</sup> display<br /><sup>15</sup> pretending to have<br /><sup>16</sup> distracted<br /><sup>17</sup> tolerate</p><div class=\"section-rotate\"><span>C ‣ Expressions with set and put </span><img class=\"speaker-louder\" source=\"data/U_092.C.mp3\" src=\"icons/speaker_louder.png\" title=\"C ‣ Expressions with set and put\" /></div><p>He has <strong>set his heart/sights on</strong> becoming a ballet dancer.
