Even if you&rsquo;re a <strong>genius</strong><sup>2</sup>, you&rsquo;ll have to <strong>do some revision</strong>. If the exam happens every year, you can <strong>revise </strong>by looking at <strong>past papers</strong><sup>3</sup>. Some things can be <strong>memorised </strong>or <strong>learnt (off ) by heart</strong>. But <strong>rote-learning</strong><sup>4</sup> is not sufficient for most subjects. It is also possible to use <strong>mnemonics</strong><sup>5</sup>. However, all things considered, the best idea is to <strong>bury yourself in your books</strong><sup>6</sup> and to study <strong>intensively</strong><sup>7</sup> until you <strong>know the subject inside out</strong><sup>8</sup>.</div><p><sup>1</sup> study in a very concentrated way for a short time<br /><sup>2</sup> an exceptionally clever person<br /><sup>3</sup> exam papers from previous years<br /><sup>4</sup> learning purely by repetition<br /><sup>5</sup> /niˈmɒnɪks/ tricks that help you remember something, for example: &lsquo;i&rsquo; before &lsquo;e&rsquo; except aft er &lsquo;c&rsquo; is a mnemonic for English spelling (e.g. friend, but receive)<br /><sup>6</sup> spend the maximum time studying<br /><sup>7</sup> in a very focused way<br /><sup>8</sup> know it completely</p><div class=\"section-rotate\"><span>B ‣ Academic writing </span><img class=\"speaker-louder\" source=\"data/U_001.B.mp3\" src=\"icons/speaker_louder.png\" title=\"B ‣ Academic writing\" /></div><p><strong>composition </strong>could be just 50&ndash;100 words, oft en used for school work</p><p><strong>essay </strong>longer than a composition, more serious, hundreds or thousands of words</p><p><strong>assignment </strong>a long essay, oft en part of a course, usually thousands of words</p><p><strong>project </strong>like an assignment, but emphasis on student&rsquo;s own material and topic</p><p><strong>portfolio </strong>a collection of individual pieces of work; may include drawings and other examples of creative work as well as writing</p><p><strong>dissertation </strong>a long, research-based work, perhaps 10&ndash;15,000 words, for a degree or diploma</p><p><strong>thesis </strong>a very long, original, research-based work, perhaps 80&ndash;100,000 words, for a higher degree (e.g. PhD)</p><p class=\"box_shadow_para\">It&rsquo;s a good idea to start with a <strong>mind map</strong><sup>1</sup> when preparing an essay. Always write a <strong>first draft</strong><sup>2</sup> before <strong>writing up</strong> the final version. Your essay should be all your own work; <strong>plagiarism</strong><sup>3</sup> is a very serious offence in colleges and universities. It is an increasing problem because it is so easy to cut and paste from materials available on the internet, and students have to sign a <strong>plagiarism form</strong> to say that the work they are handing in is all their own and that they <strong>acknowledge</strong><sup>4</sup> any sources they have used. There is usually a <strong>deadline</strong><sup>5</sup>. Aft er the essay is <strong>submitted</strong><sup>6</sup>, it will be <strong>assessed</strong><sup>7</sup> and usually you can get <strong>feedback</strong><sup>8</sup>.</p><p><sup>1</sup> diagram that lays out ideas for a topic and how they are connected to one another<br /><sup>2</sup> first, rough version<br /><sup>3</sup> /ˈpleɪdʒərɪzəm/ using other people&rsquo;s work as if it was yours<br /><sup>4</sup> give details of<br /><sup>5</sup> date by which you must hand in the work<br /><sup>6</sup> handed in; <em>formal</em><br /><sup>7</sup> evaluated and given a grade<br /><sup>8</sup> comments from the teacher/tutor</p><div class=\"section-rotate\"><span>C ‣ Aspects of higher academic study </span><img class=\"speaker-louder\" source=\"data/U_001.C.mp3\" src=\"icons/speaker_louder.png\" title=\"C ‣ Aspects of higher academic study\" /></div><p></p><p class=\"box_shadow_para\">University academics <strong>carry out research</strong><sup>1</sup> and are expected to read <strong>academic journals</strong><sup>2</sup>, which publish <strong>papers/articles</strong> on specialised subjects. If a library does not have a copy of a book or journal, you may be able to <strong>access it online</strong><sup>3</sup> or you can usually get it through an <strong>inter-library loan</strong><sup>4</sup>. <strong>Open educational resources</strong><sup>5</sup> are particularly convenient for many students. Academic study can be very demanding, and some students <strong>drop&nbsp;out</strong><sup>6</sup>, but the majority survive till finals<sup>7</sup> and become <strong>well-qualified</strong><sup>8</sup> members of their future professions.</p><p><sup>1</sup> less formal is <strong>do research</strong><br /><sup>2</sup> magazines with academic articles (we do not use the word <em>magazine </em>to talk about this kind of academic publication)<br /><sup>3</sup> get hold of (it) on the internet<br /><sup>4</sup> system where libraries exchange books/journals with one another<br /><sup>5</sup> online materials that can be freely used by teachers and students anywhere<br /><sup>6</sup> leave the course before the end<br /><sup>7</sup> last&nbsp;exams before the end of a college or university course<br /><sup>8</sup> with the right formal qualifications</p>",

This is often referred to in the debates over <strong>selective</strong><sup>2</sup> versus <strong>comprehensive</strong><sup>3</sup> <strong>schooling</strong><sup>4</sup>. The main issue is whether everyone has the same opportunities for educational achievement or whether <strong>elitism</strong><sup>5</sup> of one sort or another is <strong>inherent in</strong><sup>6</sup> the system.<p><strong>League tables</strong><sup>7</sup> for schools and colleges may actually help unintentionally to <strong>perpetuate</strong><sup>8</sup> inequalities, while claiming to promote the raising of standards. Inevitably, league tables divide educational institutions into good and bad, success and failure, resulting in a <strong>two-tier system</strong><sup>9</sup>, or at least that is how the public <strong>perceives</strong><sup>10</sup> it. The ability of <strong>better-off</strong><sup>11</sup> parents and <strong>well-endowed</strong><sup>12</sup> schools to push children towards the institutions at the top of the league may, in the long term, have the effect of <strong>depressing</strong><sup>13</sup> opportunity for the <strong>less well-off</strong><sup>14</sup> or for children from home environments that do not provide the push and motivation to <strong>excel</strong><sup>15</sup>.</p>Financial support of different kinds can help to make educational opportunity more equal. There are, for example, <strong>scholarships</strong><sup>16</sup> or <strong>bursaries</strong><sup>17</sup> that make it possible for less privileged youngsters to afford <strong>tertiary</strong><sup>18</sup> education. <strong>Student loans</strong><sup>19</sup> allow <strong>undergraduates</strong><sup>20</sup> to pay for their <strong>tuition fees</strong><sup>21</sup> and living expenses while they are studying. But few would claim that real equality of opportunity has been achieved.</div><p><sup>1</sup> when everyone has the same chances<br /><sup>2</sup> pupils are chosen for entry, usually for academic reasons, though, in the case of some private schools, parents&rsquo; ability to pay school fees may be a factor in selection<br /><sup>3</sup> everyone enters without exams and education is free, paid for by the government<br /><sup>4</sup> education received at school<br /><sup>5</sup> when you favour a small, privileged group<br /><sup>6</sup> existing as a basic part of something<br /><sup>7</sup> lists of schools or colleges, from the best down to the&nbsp;worst, based on exam results and, sometimes, other&nbsp;criteria<br /><sup>8</sup> make something continue<br /><sup>9</sup> a system with two separate levels, one of which is better&nbsp;than the other<br /><sup>10</sup> sees, considers<br /><sup>11</sup> richer<br /><sup>12</sup> receiving a lot of money in grants, gifts from rich&nbsp;people,&nbsp;etc. [= <strong>endowments</strong>]<br /><sup>13</sup> reducing<br /><sup>14</sup> poorer<br /><sup>15</sup> achieve an excellent standard<br /><sup>16</sup> money given to pay for studies, usually provided on the basis of academic merit<br /><sup>17</sup> money given to pay for studies, usually provided on the basis of need<br /><sup>18</sup> education at university or college level<br /><sup>19</sup> money that students can borrow from a bank while studying and then pay back once they are in work<br /><sup>20</sup> students doing a first degree [<strong>postgraduates </strong>= students&nbsp;doing a further degree]<br /><sup>21</sup> money paid to receive teaching</p><div class=\"section-rotate\"><span>B ‣ Other debates and issues </span><img class=\"speaker-louder\" source=\"data/U_002.B.mp3\" src=\"icons/speaker_louder.png\" title=\"B ‣ Other debates and issues\" /></div><p>Some people think we should return to an emphasis on <strong>the three Rs</strong>, the traditional, basic skills.

However, those who go into the world of business have to make a rapid transition and learn about <strong>dress codes</strong><sup>2</sup> in the workplace. Business <strong>attire</strong><sup>3</sup> needs to project a professional image, and clothing that <strong>reveals</strong><sup>4</sup> too much <strong>cleavage</strong><sup>5</sup> (for women), or your back, your chest or your <strong>midriff</strong><sup>6</sup> is not appropriate, even in a casual business setting. For women, see-through <strong>fabrics</strong><sup>7</sup> should be avoided, and skirts should not be too tight or too short, though nobody wants to look <strong>frumpy</strong><sup>8</sup>. For men, trousers should not be too tight, or shirts too open. Women often need a good choice of <strong>outfits</strong><sup>9</sup> and men find a good range of <strong>suits</strong><sup>10</sup>, ties and casual trousers and jackets <strong>invaluable</strong><sup>11</sup>. <strong>Accessories</strong><sup>12</sup>, e.g. jewellery, shoes and <strong>cufflinks</strong><sup>13</sup>, can also enhance the professional look. Some offices have <strong>dress-down days</strong><sup>14</sup>, often Fridays, when staff can wear more casual clothes. In other jobs, of course, people are required to wear <strong>uniforms</strong>, or <strong>protective clothing</strong> such as <strong>overalls</strong><sup>15</sup> and <strong>safety helmets</strong><sup>16</sup>.</p><p><sup>1</sup> untidy [noun: <strong>scruff </strong>= person who dresses in an untidy way]<br /><sup>2</sup> accepted way of dressing in a particular social group<br /><sup>3</sup> clothing; <em>formal</em><br /><sup>4</sup> shows<br /><sup>5</sup> space between a woman&rsquo;s breasts<br /><sup>6</sup> part of the body between the chest and the waist<br /><sup>7</sup> materials<br /><sup>8</sup> old-fashioned and boring<br /><sup>9</sup> set of clothes for a particular occasion<br /><sup>10</sup> jacket and trousers in the same material<br /><sup>11</sup> extremely useful<br /><sup>12</sup> extra items added to clothing for useful or decorative purposes<br /><sup>13</sup> decorative objects used to fasten the cuffs on men&rsquo;s shirts<br /><sup>14</sup> days when people wear less formal clothes<br /><sup>15</sup> (plural noun) piece of clothing covering all the body, usually worn over other clothing to protect it when working<br /><sup>16</sup>hat to protect the head</p><div class=\"common-mistakes-cover language-help-cover\"><h3>Language <span>help</span></h3><div>Invaluable means extremely valuable.

The wedding&rsquo;s at the end of the month. I think the <strong>wedding party</strong><sup>5</sup> will include a lot of our year from school; that&rsquo;ll be nice. They&rsquo;re having the <strong>reception</strong><sup>6</sup> at the Royal Hotel, very posh. The following week Josh has got his annual company ball.

At&nbsp;the end of the 19th century, for example, people were shocked by <strong>Impressionism</strong><sup>1</sup>, criticising its practitioners as careless <strong>daubers</strong><sup>2</sup>. Later, when faced with <strong>Cubist</strong><sup>3</sup> paintings, the public were puzzled by those too. The <strong>Surrealists</strong><sup>4</sup> were initially <strong>deemed</strong><sup>5</sup> crazy. <strong>Op-art</strong><sup>6</sup> was criticised because its <strong>subject matter</strong><sup>7</sup> was said to consist of nothing of significance. However, nowadays, liking <strong>Surrealism</strong><sup>8</sup> or Op-art is considered perfectly acceptable, and images from these <strong>schools of art</strong><sup>9</sup> appear everywhere, from posters to advertising campaigns. Perhaps because of the ubiquity of advertising, people tend to be more <strong>visually literate</strong><sup>10</sup> than they used to be, and so are perhaps <strong>inured to</strong><sup>11</sup> surprises. Perhaps new movements in art will meet with less hostility in future.</div><p><sup>1, 3, 4, 6, 8</sup> types of artist and schools of art of the last 150 years<br /><sup>2</sup> someone who paints quickly and carelessly (disapproving)<br /><sup>5</sup> considered; formal<br /><sup>7</sup> content<br /><sup>9</sup> art movement<br /><sup>10</sup> educated with regard to art<br /><sup>11</sup> not affected by</p><div class=\"section-rotate\"><span>B ‣ Words for commenting on art </span><img class=\"speaker-louder\" source=\"data/U_021.B.mp3\" src=\"icons/speaker_louder.png\" title=\"B ‣ Words for commenting on art\" /></div><p><strong>original</strong>: new in a special and interesting way (<em>opp</em>. = <strong>predictable</strong>)</p><p><strong>highbrow</strong>: intended for educated, intelligent people (often disapproving) (<em>opp</em>. = <strong>lowbrow</strong>)</p><p><strong>impenetrable</strong>: extremely difficult to understand (<em>opp</em>. = <strong>transparent</strong>)</p><p><strong>sophisticated</strong>: showing advanced skills and understanding (<em>opp</em>. = <strong>primitive</strong>)</p><p><strong>challenging</strong>: demanding considerable effort to be understood (<em>opp</em>. = <strong>undemanding</strong>)</p><p><strong>dazzling</strong>: inspiring great admiration because it is brilliant in some way (<em>opp</em>. = <strong>pedestrian</strong>)</p><p><strong>evocative</strong>: calling up images and memories (<em>opp</em>. = <strong>uninspiring</strong>)</p><p><strong>thought-provoking</strong>: making people think (<em>opp</em>. = <strong>unstimulating</strong>)</p><p><strong>exquisite</strong>: having rare beauty or delicacy (<em>opp</em>. = <strong>clumsy</strong>)</p><p><strong>intriguing</strong>: interesting because it is strange or mysterious (<em>opp</em>. = <strong>dreary</strong>)</p><p><strong>peerless</strong>: better than any other (<em>opp</em>. = <strong>run-of-the-mill</strong>)</p><p><strong>tongue-in-cheek</strong>: not intended to be taken seriously, despite appearing serious (<em>opp</em>. = <strong>earnest</strong>)</p><p><strong>priceless</strong>: extremely valuable (<em>opp</em>. = <strong>worthless</strong>)</p><p><strong>skilful</strong>: clever, masterly, done well (<em>opp</em>. = <strong>poorly done</strong>)</p><div class=\"section-rotate\"><span>C ‣ Art and metaphor </span><img class=\"speaker-louder\" source=\"data/U_021.C.mp3\" src=\"icons/speaker_louder.png\" title=\"C ‣ Art and metaphor\" /></div><p>Notice how words connected with art can be used when talking about literature.</p><p class=\"box_shadow_para\">The writer <strong>paints </strong>his hero in a fascinating <strong>light</strong>.

Labels do not always help. Adjectives such as &lsquo;<strong>wholesome</strong><sup>1</sup>&rsquo;, &lsquo;farm fresh&rsquo; and &lsquo;homemade&rsquo; can be rather vague and meaningless, while the international numbering system for <strong>additives</strong><sup>2</sup> is often incomprehensible to people. Some familiar descriptions, however, do have a clear official meaning, for example &lsquo;<strong>wholefoods</strong><sup>3</sup>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<strong>free-range</strong><sup>4</sup> eggs&rsquo;, &lsquo;<strong>gluten-free</strong><sup>5</sup> bread&rsquo; or &lsquo;contains no artificial colours or <strong>preservatives</strong><sup>6</sup>&rsquo;. Clear and scientifically accurate descriptions can be vital for people who suffer from food <strong>allergies</strong><sup>7</sup> and for vegetarians or <strong>vegans</strong><sup>8</sup> who want to know exactly what is in a product, as well as being important for consumers looking for natural or <strong>unprocessed</strong><sup>9</sup> foods, or those concerned about <strong>animal welfare</strong><sup>10</sup> who may wish to avoid food produced by <strong>battery-farming</strong><sup>11</sup> methods and so on. With the growth in popularity of <strong>convenience foods</strong><sup>12</sup>, alongside public health concerns over bad diet and obesity, simple and unambiguous <strong>nutrition labels</strong><sup>13</sup> are more important than ever. An example of a simple system is <strong>traffic-light labelling</strong><sup>14</sup>, which indicates high (red), medium (amber) or low (green) levels of such things as fat, sugar and salt. Finally, good labelling tells us where the food was produced and under what conditions, for example <strong>fair trade</strong><sup>15</sup> products.</div><p><sup>1</sup> good for you<br /><sup>2</sup> substance added to food to improve its taste or appearance or to preserve it<br /><sup>3</sup> foods that have not had any of their natural features taken away or any artificial substances added<br /><sup>4</sup> produced by farm animals that are allowed to move around outside and are not kept in cages or stalls<br /><sup>5</sup> not containing a protein which is contained in wheat and some other grains<br /><sup>6</sup> chemicals used to stop food from decaying<br /><sup>7</sup> condition that makes a person become ill or develop skin or breathing problems because they have eaten certain foods or been near certain substances.

Suriname&rsquo;s <strong>tourist sector</strong><sup>4</sup> is relatively modest and the emphasis is on what makes the country different for the <strong>discerning</strong><sup>5</sup> traveller. Other Caribbean nations may <strong>boast</strong><sup>6</sup> better sand, sea and sun, but because of that, you won&rsquo;t ﬁnd <strong>hordes</strong><sup>7</sup> of people in Suriname. What you will ﬁnd is a <strong>wealth of</strong><sup>8</sup> wildlife with a huge range of <strong>ﬂora and fauna</strong><sup>9</sup>. More than 12% of the country is given over to <strong>national parks</strong><sup>10</sup> and <strong>nature reserves</strong><sup>11</sup> and large <strong>tracts</strong><sup>12</sup> of the country are covered by <strong>virgin</strong><sup>13</sup> rainforest.

It can be used in this way both as a noun and a verb: Let&rsquo;s have a drink together <strong>to cement</strong> our partnership.</p><p><strong>To come up against a brick wall</strong> is used metaphorically, meaning to meet a barrier: When I tried to find out who had opened my letters, I <strong>came up against a brick wall</strong>.</p><p><strong>Ceiling </strong>can be used to suggest a limit to something: They put a <strong>ceiling </strong>on the number of planned redundancies.</p><p>The <strong>glass ceiling</strong> is a phrase used to refer to an invisible barrier that stops people, especially women, from rising to top positions at work.</p><p><strong>Roof </strong>is used in a number of common metaphors: The <strong>roof fell in</strong> on my world on the day he died. [My world collapsed &hellip;]</p><p>Conversely, the <strong>floor </strong>can <strong>give way</strong> metaphorically when you faint.</p><p>The informal phrase <strong>go through the roof</strong> is used about prices, meaning to increase in a rapid, uncontrolled fashion.</p><p><strong>Hit the roof</strong> means get very angry: My mother will <strong>hit the roof</strong> when she sees what we&rsquo;ve&nbsp;done.</p><p><strong>Window</strong>, both literally and metaphorically, means an opening.</p><p>A <strong>window of opportunity</strong> is a chance to do something special: If you see a <strong>window of opportunity</strong>, then take advantage of it.</p><p>If a quality or idea <strong>goes out (of) the window</strong>, it means it departs: Once the boys started going around together, common sense <strong>went out of the window</strong>.</p><p>As a very tall building, <strong>tower </strong>conveys an idea of distance from ordinary people. If someone lives in an <strong>ivory tower</strong>, he/she does not know about the unpleasant and ordinary things that happen in life: Academics are often criticised for living in their <strong>ivory towers</strong>.</p><p>If a person is a <strong>tower of strength</strong>, they are extremely strong (in an emotional rather than a physical sense): Our friends were a <strong>tower of strength</strong> when our house burnt down.</p><p>If a person or thing <strong>towers above</strong> something or someone, they are either outstandingly tall or outstanding in some other positive way: Lauren <strong>towers above</strong> all her classmates, although she is actually one of the youngest students.</p><div class=\"section-rotate\"><span>B ‣ Entrances </span><img class=\"speaker-louder\" source=\"data/U_030.B.mp3\" src=\"icons/speaker_louder.png\" title=\"B ‣ Entrances\" /></div><p><img src=\"data/Unit30-1.jpg\" style=\"width:100%; max-width:200px; margin-right:20px; float:left\" /><strong>Gateway</strong> is used metaphorically in the phrase <strong>be a gateway to</strong>, meaning give an opportunity to get somewhere: A degree in law is a <strong>gateway to</strong> a well-paid job.</p><p><strong>Door </strong>can also be used in a similar way to gateway above, but it is also used in many other metaphorical phrases as well: Failing his final exams <strong>closed/shut</strong> a lot of <strong>doors </strong>for him. Knowing several languages <strong>opens doors</strong> when it comes to finding work. The new year gives us the opportunity to <strong>close the door on</strong> the past and make a fresh start. Doing something <strong>through/by the back door</strong> suggests doing it unofficially: Jack came into the business <strong>by the back door</strong> &ndash; the manager knew him from university. Doing something <strong>behind closed doors</strong> suggests secrecy: Unfortunately, the decision was taken <strong>behind closed doors</strong> and no one knows exactly why it was made.</p><p><strong>Key </strong>can be used as a noun to suggest the importance of something: This research may <strong>provide/hold the key to</strong> developing a cure for cancer. Knowing the right people is <strong>the key to success</strong> in that country.</p>",

All that&rsquo;s needed is that the petition is properly <strong>set out</strong><sup>1</sup> and has the signature and address of at least one person. A petition can also be created and submitted online, as an e-petition. The text of the petition is published in <strong>Hansard</strong><sup>2</sup>. There is a procedure for petitions in the Lords, but it is very rarely used. Generally, MPs will <strong>present</strong><sup>3</sup> all petitions they receive from their <strong>constituents</strong><sup>4</sup>. MPs present petitions by either giving a short statement in the debating chamber of the House of Commons or by simply placing the petition in the Petition Bag (which hangs behind the <strong>Speaker&rsquo;s</strong><sup>5</sup> Chair). If a petition gets 100,000 signatures, the government will respond and it will be considered for debate. A copy of the petition is sent to the appropriate government department.

I also read the <strong>editorial</strong><sup>2</sup> (or <strong>leader</strong>); it helps me form my opinion on things. Although national papers <strong>cover</strong><sup>3</sup> all the important news, I find that if you just want to sell your car or something, the <strong>classified ads</strong><sup>4</sup> (or <strong>classifieds</strong>) in a local paper is the best place. I love the Sunday papers, especially the <strong>supplements</strong><sup>5</sup> with articles on travel, food, fashion and so on.

Journalists also attend <strong>press conferences</strong><sup>6</sup> where politicians or others may <strong>issue a statement</strong> or <strong>press release</strong><sup>7</sup>.

This may happen at the doctor&rsquo;s surgery or, sometimes, during a <strong>home visit</strong>. A <strong>locum </strong>is a doctor who does the job of another doctor who is ill or on holiday. Most medical care, whether it is for an <strong>acute condition</strong><sup>1</sup> or a <strong>chronic </strong>condition, is provided through the primary care system. <strong>Secondary care</strong> is provided by specialists in special clinics or hospitals. Patients are <strong>referred to</strong> a specialist by their doctor. These may specialise, for example, in a particular <strong>organ</strong><sup>2</sup> or a specific age group. Specialists (what they specialise in is in brackets) include, among many others: <strong>ophthalmologists </strong>(eyes), <strong>cardiologists</strong> (heart), <strong>psychiatrists </strong>(the mind), <strong>dermatologists </strong>(skin), <strong>gynaecologists </strong>(women&rsquo;s reproductive systems), <strong>obstetricians </strong>(pregnancy and childbirth), <strong>paediatricians </strong>(children), and <strong>anaesthetists </strong>(<strong>anaesthesia </strong>or stopping people from feeling pain during surgery).

The production of plaque is associated with high levels of <strong>cholesterol</strong><sup>4</sup> and clogged blood vessels can lead to a heart attack or a <strong>stroke</strong><sup>5</sup>. Some foods, such as eggs and shellfish, while <strong>nutritious</strong><sup>6</sup>, are also <strong>cholesterol-rich</strong>, but, if eaten in moderation, do not significantly raise cholesterol levels or <strong>pose a danger</strong><sup>7</sup>. &lsquo;Bad cholesterol&rsquo; is counteracted by <strong>fibre</strong><sup>8</sup> in our diet, and a <strong>high-fibre</strong> diet is often recommended by health experts. Fibre causes less fat to be absorbed by the blood vessels.

This type of exercise lowers your blood pressure and can help <strong>diabetics</strong><sup>2</sup> too, by helping their <strong>insulin</strong><sup>3</sup> work more effectively. Running or jogging is also a great way to <strong>burn calories</strong>, and you don&rsquo;t have to be excessively <strong>sporty</strong><sup>4</sup> to do it. Based on a calculation of your body weight in relation to the time you devote to an activity, a person who weighs 63 kilos can burn 148 calories by jogging for 20 minutes. The same person doing half an hour of cycling at 25 kph could burn more than 330 calories. Exercise can also speed up your <strong>metabolism</strong><sup>5</sup>, which helps you to burn calories more quickly. This can help to lower your <strong>BMI</strong><sup>6</sup> to a healthy level. If you&rsquo;re <strong>intent on</strong><sup>7</sup> losing weight, running, <strong>brisk</strong><sup>8</sup> walking and fast cycling are excellent ways of doing so!</div><p><sup>1</sup> relating to the heart and blood<br /><sup>2,3</sup> people suffering from <strong>diabetes</strong>, an illness in which the body cannot cope with <strong>glucose </strong>[sugar] because it does not produce enough <strong>insulin </strong>[hormone that controls the level of sugar in the body]<br /><sup>4</sup> good at or keen on sports<br /><sup>5</sup> the rate at which your body digests food<br /><sup>6</sup> Body Mass Index &ndash; the amount of fat in your body, as a proportion of your weight<br /><sup>7</sup> determined to<br /><sup>8</sup> quick and energetic</p><div class=\"section-rotate\"><span>C ‣ Sport and fitness metaphors </span><img class=\"speaker-louder\" source=\"data/U_054.C.mp3\" src=\"icons/speaker_louder.png\" title=\"C ‣ Sport and fitness metaphors\" /></div><p>I <strong>scored an own goal</strong> when I told my boss it had only taken me a day to write the report.

I <strong>dashed </strong>into the classroom to pick up my books. She came <strong>flying </strong>out of her house. I&nbsp;<strong>raced/tore</strong> to the station and just made it in time for the last train.</p><p>The verbs <strong>nip </strong>and <strong>pop </strong>suggest going a short distance quickly, on foot or in a vehicle: I&nbsp;<strong>nipped/popped</strong> into a near by shop to buy a bottle of water.</p><p>The verb <strong>dart </strong>suggests a quick, sudden movement, often by an animal: A dragonfly <strong>darted </strong>past. I <strong>darted </strong>behind the door to hide.</p><p>The&nbsp;verbs <strong>zip </strong>and <strong>whizz </strong>are often used about vehicles going quickly: The bus <strong>whizzed/zipped</strong> past me just as I got to the bus stop.</p><p>The verb <strong>bolt </strong>also suggests fast movement over a short distance but it also has the added association of running away from something: The thieves <strong>bolted </strong>when the alarm went off.</p><p>The verb <strong>career </strong>suggests that something is moving rapidly and is out of control: The car skidded and <strong>careered</strong> down a bank. The company seems to be <strong>careering </strong>into financial ruin.</p><p>The verbs <strong>scamper, scurry, scuttle</strong> suggest small rapid steps, often used to describe the way a small animal runs: As we went into the dark shed, we saw mice <strong>scampering </strong>away and spiders <strong>scurrying </strong>into corners. Cockroaches <strong>scuttled </strong>into a crack in the floor.</p><p>These verbs emphasise the fact that speed is increasing: <strong>speed up, accelerate</strong>. <strong>Accelerate </strong>is used only about transport, whereas <strong>speed up</strong> can also refer to movement on foot. Both verbs can be used figuratively: We&rsquo;d better <strong>speed up</strong> if we&rsquo;re going to get there on time. The growth of the company has <strong>accelerated </strong>since it started exporting.</p><div class=\"section-rotate\"><span>B ‣ Going up or down fast </span><img class=\"speaker-louder\" source=\"data/U_066.B.mp3\" src=\"icons/speaker_louder.png\" title=\"B ‣ Going up or down fast\" /></div><p>These verbs suggest a downward movement, as well as speed: <strong>plunge, plummet</strong>: He put on a lifejacket and <strong>plunged </strong>into the icy water. Notice that they are mainly used metaphorically: When export sales began to decline, our hopes of&nbsp;business success <strong>plummeted</strong>. After the death of his father, he was <strong>plunged </strong>into despair.</p><p>These verbs suggest a fast upward movement: <strong>rocket, soar</strong>. Notice that they are mainly used metaphorically and have strong associations with financial matters such as prices and share values: When our export sales <strong>rocketed</strong>, our hopes <strong>soared</strong>.</p><p>The primary association of <strong>soar </strong>is with birds, and when it is used about people&rsquo;s feelings it provides&nbsp;associations of happiness and being carefree: My heart <strong>soared </strong>when I heard that he was&nbsp;coming home.</p><p>The opposite of <strong>soar </strong>and <strong>rocket </strong>in a financial context would be <strong>slump </strong>or <strong>tumble</strong>. Both suggest a rapid downward movement: Share prices <strong>slumped </strong>(or <strong>plummeted</strong>) on the stock market yesterday, with telecommunications companies <strong>tumbling </strong>most dramatically of all.</p><div class=\"section-rotate\"><span>C ‣ Going slowly </span><img class=\"speaker-louder\" source=\"data/U_066.C.mp3\" src=\"icons/speaker_louder.png\" title=\"C ‣ Going slowly\" /></div><p>These intransitive verbs emphasise that the movement is slow: <strong>crawl, creep</strong>. They are often used metaphorically: Prices have been <strong>creeping </strong>up since May. It was rush hour and the traffic was <strong>crawling </strong>along.</p><p><strong>Totter </strong>also suggests a fairly slow movement, but it is one that is particularly unsteady as well: Mina <strong>tottered </strong>down the road, laden with parcels and bags.</p><p><strong>Sidle </strong>means to walk anxiously and nervously: Sam <strong>sidled up</strong> to the boss&rsquo;s desk and coughed to attract his attention.</p><p><strong>Dawdle </strong>means to move more slowly than is necessary, or to waste time: Don&rsquo;t <strong>dawdle </strong>on the way&nbsp;home.</p>",

It is usually implied that such a promise is unrealistic: The afternoon <strong>promises </strong>to be interesting! [the speaker expects it will be interesting = We <strong>anticipate </strong>that the afternoon will be interesting] To <strong>anticipate </strong>something is to expect it before it happens.</p><p><strong>Promise </strong>can also be used to indicate positive future development: The child already shows great <strong>promise </strong>as a violinist. She&rsquo;s a <strong>promising </strong>artist although her style is still rather immature.</p><p>An <strong>oath / to swear</strong> is a formal promise. In court, witnesses are <strong>put on/under oath</strong> when they have to swear to tell the truth.</p><p>Notice how <strong>swear </strong>is often used in informal spoken English in expressions:</p><p>I <strong>could have sworn</strong> I left my purse on the table. [was absolutely certain]</p><p>I think she lives on Rose Street but I <strong>couldn&rsquo;t swear to</strong> it. [am not totally sure]</p><p>My mother <strong>swears by</strong> these vitamin pills. [uses them and thinks they are wonderful]</p><p>Tom often uses <strong>swear words / bad language</strong>. [taboo expressions]</p><p>To <strong>pledge (a pledge)</strong> means to promise something, often friendship or money: Mayor Williams has <strong>pledged</strong> millions of dollars to improve the city centre.</p><p>To <strong>vow (a vow)</strong> is to make a determined decision or promise to do something: He <strong>vowed </strong>to discover who had killed his father. At a marriage ceremony, the couple <strong>exchange vows</strong>. Both <strong>vow </strong>and <strong>pledge </strong>are found more in written than spoken English.</p><p><strong>New Year&rsquo;s resolutions</strong> are special promises <strong>to turn over a new leaf</strong> at the beginning of a new year. [to change your behaviour for the better]</p><p><strong>Resolutions </strong>and <strong>vows</strong>, like <strong>promises </strong>or <strong>pledges</strong>, can be <strong>made, kept</strong> or <strong>broken</strong>.</p><p>If you <strong>go back on your word</strong>, you break a promise.</p><div class=\"common-mistakes-cover language-help-cover\"><h3>Language <span>help</span></h3><div><em>Swear </em>can mean either to make a solemn promise or to use taboo language.</div></div><p></p><div class=\"section-rotate\"><span>B ‣ Bets </span><img class=\"speaker-louder\" source=\"data/U_076.B.mp3\" src=\"icons/speaker_louder.png\" title=\"B ‣ Bets\" /></div><p>To <strong>bet (a bet)</strong> is to risk something, usually money, on the unknown result of something, in the hope of winning more money; people spend (and lose) a lot of money <strong>betting </strong>on horse racing or football matches, for example. Putting money on the results of a game of some kind is called <strong>gambling</strong>.</p><p>The amount of money that you risk is your <strong>stake</strong>. You can <strong>stake </strong>a sum of money on something happening. If something is <strong>at stake</strong>, then it is at risk: Many lives will be <strong>at stake</strong> if the flood barrier is not built. A more formal word for <strong>bet </strong>is <strong>wager</strong>: She put a wager of &pound;10 on a horse. Both words can be used in a non-literal sense: I&rsquo;d <strong>wager </strong>that he will come to a bad end.</p><p>There are a number of informal expressions connected with betting.</p><p><strong>Your best bet</strong> would be to look for a part-time job. [the best decision or choice]</p><p>You think Stuart&rsquo;ll win? <strong>Don&rsquo;t bet on it!</strong> [I think what you&rsquo;ve just said is unlikely to happen]</p><p>My granny enjoys <strong>having a flutter</strong> on the horses. [having a small bet]</p><p>I&rsquo;d <strong>put (good) money / bet my life on</strong> James getting the job. [I&rsquo;m sure that James will get the job]</p><p>Do you feel like coming to the beach with us? <strong>You bet!</strong> [I certainly do!]</p><p>You can also <strong>hedge your bets</strong> by investing in several companies. [protect yourself from the results of making a single wrong choice]</p><p>The <strong>odds </strong>are the statistical or betting chances of something happening.</p><p>What are <strong>the odds of</strong> Olivia finishing her course, do you think?</p><p><strong>The odds are against</strong> her getting that&nbsp;promotion.</p>",

It is estimated that English vocabulary has its <strong>sources</strong><sup>2</sup> in at least 120 languages. Some languages have, of course, provided English with more words than others. English started out with a basic <strong>Anglo-Saxon</strong><sup>3</sup> <strong>word stock</strong><sup>4</sup>. <strong>Viking</strong><sup>5</sup> and <strong>Norman</strong><sup>6</sup> invaders from the 9th century onwards <strong>enriched</strong><sup>7</sup> the language enormously with large numbers of words brought from their own languages. The Vikings brought new words of Germanic origin while the Normans spoke a form of French. Both sets of invaders <strong>had </strong>an enormous <strong>impact on</strong><sup>8</sup> English vocabulary, explaining why English may sometimes seem to have several words for the same basic <strong>concept</strong><sup>9</sup>. During the Renaissance of the 15th to the 17th centuries, scholars introduced many words of <strong>classical origin</strong><sup>10</sup>. And throughout history, English speakers&rsquo; contact with the world as explorers, scientists, traders, pirates and holiday-makers has had <strong>linguistic consequences</strong><sup>11</sup> in a wealth of new words from every part of the world that they reached. These words taken from other languages are sometimes referred to as <strong>loanwords </strong>or <strong>borrowings</strong>.</div><p><sup>1</sup> vocabulary (specialist term)<br /><sup>2</sup> where something comes from<br /><sup>3</sup> Old English<br /><sup>4</sup> set of words<br /><sup>5</sup> Norse, from the north of Europe, e.g. Denmark or Norway<br /><sup>6</sup> from Normandy, a region in the north of France<br /><sup>7</sup> made richer<br /><sup>8</sup> influenced, had an effect on<br /><sup>9</sup> idea<br /><sup>10</sup> from Latin or Ancient Greek<br /><sup>11</sup> results affecting language</p><div class=\"section-rotate\"><span>B ‣ English words from other languages </span><img class=\"speaker-louder\" source=\"data/U_089.B.mp3\" src=\"icons/speaker_louder.png\" title=\"B ‣ English words from other languages\" /></div><p></p><table class=\"tbl-1-2\"><tbody><tr class=\"background-2\"><td>language</td><td>word</td><td>meaning</td><td>phrase</td></tr><tr><td>Arabic</td><td><strong>amber</strong></td><td>yellowy-orange substance originating from tree resin and used in jewellery</td><td>an <strong>amber </strong>necklace</td></tr><tr><td>Dutch</td><td><strong>roster</strong></td><td>list of people&rsquo;s turns for jobs</td><td>the cooking <strong>roster</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Farsi</td><td><strong>tabby</strong></td><td>grey and brown stripy cat</td><td>our old <strong>tabby</strong></td></tr><tr><td>German</td><td><strong>gimmick</strong></td><td>an amusing or unusual way of attracting attention</td><td>advertising <strong>gimmicks</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Greek</td><td><strong>tonic</strong></td><td>medicine to make you feel stronger and better</td><td>take a <strong>tonic</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Hindi</td><td><strong>cot</strong></td><td>child&rsquo;s bed with high vertical sides x</td><td>child&rsquo;s bed with high vertical sides sleep in a <strong>cot</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Icelandic</td><td><strong>mumps</strong></td><td>a childhood illness</td><td>have <strong>mumps</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Japanese</td><td><strong>karaoke</strong></td><td>type of entertainment where ordinary people sing to popular music</td><td>a <strong>karaoke </strong>machine</td></tr><tr><td>Portuguese</td><td><strong>palaver</strong></td><td>unnecessary trouble</td><td>What a <strong>palaver</strong>!</td></tr><tr><td>Russian</td><td><strong>intelligentsia</strong></td><td>social class of intellectuals</td><td>19th-century <strong>intelligentsia</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Spanish</td><td><strong>hammock</strong></td><td>net hung and used as a bed</td><td>sleep in a <strong>hammock</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Turkish</td><td><strong>turban</strong></td><td>type of men&rsquo;s headwear, made from a long piece of cloth</td><td>wear a <strong>turban</strong></td></tr></tbody></table><div class=\"section-rotate\"><span>C ‣ False friends </span><img class=\"speaker-louder\" source=\"data/U_089.C.mp3\" src=\"icons/speaker_louder.png\" title=\"C ‣ False friends\" /></div><p>Some English words may look like words in your language but have a different meaning. Such words are known as <strong>false friends</strong>, e.g. the German word <em>Gift </em>looks like the English word <strong>gift </strong>[present] but actually means <em>poison</em> in German. The English word <strong>sympathetic </strong>resembles a word meaning, simply, <em>nice </em>in many other European languages, but in English <strong>sympathetic </strong>has a much narrower meaning [understanding and caring about someone else&rsquo;s suffering]. Note also that the pronunciation of a word borrowed into English may be quite different from its pronunciation in its language of origin.</p>",

Sometimes the meanings are clearly related &ndash; <em>flat </em>as in <em>countryside </em>has a connection with <em>flat </em>as in <em>apartment </em>in that they both include an idea of being on one level. Sometimes, however, there is no connection at all. For example, the meaning of <em>fair </em>as in Book <em>Fair </em>has no obvious connection with any of the other meanings of <em>fair</em>. Words like this can be called <strong>homographs </strong>(words with the same spellings but different meanings).</p><div class=\"section-rotate\"><span>B ‣ Being aware of polysemy </span><img class=\"speaker-louder\" source=\"data/U_091.B.mp3\" src=\"icons/speaker_louder.png\" title=\"B ‣ Being aware of polysemy\" /></div><p>It is useful to be aware of polysemy in English for several reasons.</p><ol class=\"ol-li-disc\"><li>You need to remember that the meaning you first learnt for a word may not be the one that it has in a new context.</li><li>You need to be aware that in English, words can sometimes be used as different parts of speech. <em>Flat </em>with its <em>apartment </em>meaning, for instance, can become an adjective, e.g. a set of <em>flat keys</em>.</li><li>Learning about the range of meanings that a word can have can help you to learn several meanings for the price of one.</li><li>It will also help you to understand jokes in English, as these are often based on polysemous words.</li></ol><p></p><div class=\"common-mistakes-cover language-help-cover\"><h3>Language <span>help</span></h3><div>The context of a word with multiple meanings will usually make it absolutely clear which of the word&rsquo;s possible meanings is intended.

It is a way of expressing something by comparing it indirectly with something else that has similar characteristics.</p><p>If we call a city a <strong>jungle</strong>, for example, we are using a metaphor. We are suggesting that a city is like a jungle, in that it is wild and full of dangers.</p><p>If we say that someone <strong>lights up our life</strong>, we are using a metaphor. We are suggesting that person is like a light in our life, in that they make our life brighter and happier.</p><div class=\"section-rotate\"><span>B ‣ Idioms and metaphors </span><img class=\"speaker-louder\" source=\"data/U_093.B.mp3\" src=\"icons/speaker_louder.png\" title=\"B ‣ Idioms and metaphors\" /></div><p><img src=\"data/Unit93-1.jpg\" style=\"width:100%; max-width:200px; border-radius:10px; margin-right:20px; float:left\" /> Many idioms are metaphorical expressions which are in common use.</p><p><strong>be on the ball</strong> [be very aware of things and ready to act &ndash; like a good footballer]</p><p>to <strong>keep someone/something on a tight rein</strong> [have a lot of control over someone/something &ndash; like a rider having control over a horse]</p><p>Some of the most common idiom-metaphors are based on parts of the body. So we might say that a building is in the <strong>heart </strong>of the city. [centre] We can call the place where a river joins the sea its <strong>mouth</strong>, and the person in charge of an organisation its <strong>head</strong>. If you say that someone <strong>has an eye for</strong> a bargain, you mean they are good at finding a bargain. If you <strong>keep a (close) eye on</strong> someone/something, you watch them carefully. If you say that something is <strong>in safe hands</strong>, you mean that the person in charge is capable. If you say that something <strong>goes hand in hand with</strong> something else, you mean that they exist together and are interconnected: Rights <strong>go hand in hand with</strong> responsibilities. If you talk about doing something using a <strong>rule of thumb</strong>, you mean you are calculating something in a way that is not exact but will allow you to be accurate enough.</p><div class=\"section-rotate\"><span>C ‣ Common metaphorical concepts in English </span><img class=\"speaker-louder\" source=\"data/U_093.C.mp3\" src=\"icons/speaker_louder.png\" title=\"C ‣ Common metaphorical concepts in English\" /></div><p>Many words in English are so frequently used in a metaphorical way that English speakers may no longer notice that they are metaphors. Here are some examples:</p><ol class=\"ol-li-disc\"><li>Intelligence and understanding are equated with light; for example, a clever person is called <strong>bright</strong> and a less intelligent person <strong>dim</strong>. If you <strong>see the light</strong>, you understand something. To <strong>cast light on</strong> something means making it easier to understand: The discovery of the poet&rsquo;s letters <strong>has cast light on</strong> his troubled relationship with his brother.</li><li>Intensity of feeling or passion is equated with temperature; someone who is enthusiastic at one time and not at another is said to <strong>blow hot and cold</strong>. If someone is <strong>hotheaded</strong>, then they react quickly on the basis of their feelings without thinking first. If you call someone <strong>cold-hearted</strong>, then you think they are without feeling.</li><li>The movement of people or traffic is equated with the movement of water; we can, for example, talk of people <strong>flooding </strong>or <strong>trickling </strong>out of a hall, or say there was a constant <strong>stream </strong>of traffic past the&nbsp;window.</li><li>Time is likened to money; both are seen as commodities that can be <strong>spent </strong>or <strong>wasted </strong>or <strong>used profitably</strong>. You can also talk about <strong>investing </strong>time, using it in a way that you think will <strong>pay dividends</strong> in future. [bring you advantages]</li><li>Business is likened to a military operation; <strong>strategies, tactics</strong> and <strong>campaigns </strong>are used in both contexts. So a company might <strong>launch an advertising campaign</strong>, for example, or work on its <strong>marketing strategy</strong>.</li></ol>",

The best way to learn them is in context. When you <strong>come across</strong> [meet] one, write it down in an example sentence.</p><p>There are a couple of important points to remember about phrasal verbs. Firstly, a verb + preposition/particle combination may have more than one meaning. <strong>Come across</strong>, for example, can also mean <em>give an impression of being</em>, as in: He can <strong>come across</strong> as unfriendly when you first meet him. <strong>Come over</strong> can also be used with the same meaning, as in: He can come over as unfriendly. Secondly, it is sensible to concentrate first on understanding phrasal verbs rather than using them. There is usually an alternative way in which you can say the same thing using a single verb. So, for example, instead of <strong>put forward</strong> a plan you can <em>propose </em>a plan, and instead of <strong>rush into</strong> a decision you can <em>make a hasty</em> decision.</p><div class=\"section-rotate\"><span>B ‣ The verb </span><img class=\"speaker-louder\" source=\"data/U_095.B.mp3\" src=\"icons/speaker_louder.png\" title=\"B ‣ The verb\" /></div><p>A very large number of phrasal verbs are formed using common verbs such as <em>come, do, get</em> or <em>go</em>, for instance. Here are some more examples with <strong>come</strong>.</p><p>I hope our plans to visit Russia <strong>come off</strong>. [happen successfully]</p><p>Sandro&rsquo;s family <strong>came over</strong> from Italy for the wedding. [travel to one place from another]</p><p>I wouldn&rsquo;t usually say something like that. I don&rsquo;t know what <strong>came over</strong> me. [influence someone to behave in a particular way]</p><p>The proposal has <strong>come under</strong> a lot of criticism. [experience something (usually unpleasant)]</p><p>If the opportunity to work in the US <strong>comes up</strong>, you must take it. [occur unexpectedly]</p><p>Our plan has <strong>come up against</strong> some obstacles. [have to deal with a problem or difficulty]</p><div class=\"section-rotate\"><span>C ‣ The preposition/particle </span><img class=\"speaker-louder\" source=\"data/U_095.C.mp3\" src=\"icons/speaker_louder.png\" title=\"C ‣ The preposition/particle\" /></div><p>The second part of a phrasal verb is a preposition or particle. This can sometimes help you understand the meaning of the phrasal verb. For example, <strong>on </strong>can often convey an idea of continuing over a period of time.</p><p>Selina decided to <strong>stay on</strong> at university and do a Master&rsquo;s degree. [remain]</p><p>Try not to <strong>dwell on</strong> the past. [keep thinking about, usually something unpleasant]</p><p>I didn&rsquo;t expect platform shoes to <strong>catch on</strong>. [become popular]</p><p>I wish she&rsquo;d stop <strong>going on</strong> about her new car. [talking at length]</p><p>The crowd was <strong>urging </strong>the runners <strong>on</strong>. [encouraging]</p><p>The weather was terrible but the climbers <strong>pressed on</strong> regardless.

Here, for example, are some from the context of work:</p><p>I need to <strong>brush up on</strong> my computer skills for my new job. [improve knowledge of something already learnt but partly forgotten]</p><p>The company <strong>laid off</strong> half its staff during the recession. [stopped employing]</p><p>Tomorrow&rsquo;s meeting has been <strong>called off</strong> because Jack is ill. [cancelled]</p><p>Sasha has <strong>thrown himself into</strong> his new job. [start doing something with great energy]</p><p>It took me a few weeks to <strong>settle in </strong>at my new office. [feel relaxed and happy]</p><p>It took me ages to <strong>put together</strong> the report. [prepare by collecting information from several sources]</p><div class=\"common-mistakes-cover language-help-cover\"><h3>Language <span>help</span></h3><div>When you learn a phrasal verb, note down the positions of the preposition/particle and the object, if there is one. For example, you can say <em>put a report together</em> or <em>put together a report</em>, but you can only say <em>rush into a decision</em> (NOT <s>rush a decision into</s>).</div></div>",

The dove, for example, is a white bird that has associations with peace. So if a journalist calls a politician a <strong>dove</strong>, they are suggesting that he or she is a peacemaker. Similarly, they might call a more aggressive, hard-line politician a <strong>hawk</strong>, a bird which hunts its prey. Some associations like those of dove and hawk will be shared by most speakers of English and they may even be included in a good dictionary for learners. Sometimes associations are not the same for all native speakers of the same language, but may vary from one geographical area to another. <strong>Black cats</strong>, for example, have associations with good luck in Britain but with <em>bad luck</em> in the USA.<br /><br />Many associations are purely personal. Someone who had a bad experience of dogs in childhood may think of a dog as being ﬁerce and frightening, whereas for others dogs may represent loyalty and friendship. The most commonly shared association of the word dog in English is &lsquo;faithfulness&rsquo;. However, the phrase <strong>a dog&rsquo;s life</strong> is used to refer to a very unhappy and unpleasant life.</div><div class=\"section-rotate\"><span>B ‣ Understanding associations </span><img class=\"speaker-louder\" source=\"data/U_096.B.mp3\" src=\"icons/speaker_louder.png\" title=\"B ‣ Understanding associations\" /></div><p>Journalists, advertisers and other writers or speakers who want to interest and entertain their audience oft en make use of word associations. A fashion advert might ask, for example, &lsquo;Would you like to have that <strong>Paris</strong> look?&rsquo;, which draws on the associations of Paris with glamour and style. Or someone might refer to <strong>cowboy builders</strong>, meaning builders who are not careful or trustworthy.</p><p>It might seem difficult at first to understand this kind of language, but your knowledge both of the world and of the primary meanings of words will help you. Paris, for example, is known throughout the world as a centre of high fashion and it is quite possible that the name Paris is associated with glamour in your own language too. If you have seen a Western, you will have seen how cowboys oft en behave in a careless and dishonest way.</p><p>Think, for example, about the words <strong>shark, scar</strong> and <strong>diamond</strong>. You probably know their literal meanings &ndash; a large sea creature with sharp teeth, a mark left on the skin aft er a cut has healed, and a precious stone, respectively &ndash; but what associations do you think they have for English speakers in general? What might someone mean if they said the following?</p><p>&lsquo;They&rsquo;re all <strong>sharks </strong>in that garage.&rsquo;<br />&lsquo;I think that new office block is a <strong>scar </strong>on the landscape.&rsquo;<br />&lsquo;Emma&rsquo;s a real <strong>diamond</strong>.&rsquo;</p><p>The idea of sharks as sharp-toothed creatures with an aggressive reputation should help you to understand that the speaker does not like the garage. The fact that a scar is a mark of a wound on something that was once unspoilt should help you to appreciate that the speaker does not like the new off ice block. The beauty and high value of a diamond as a precious stone should help you to see that the speaker has a high opinion of Emma.</p><div class=\"common-mistakes-cover language-help-cover\"><h3>Language <span>help</span></h3><div>Research into language learning shows that words are better remembered if you have personal associations in mind as you learn them.
